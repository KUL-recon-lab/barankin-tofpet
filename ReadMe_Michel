Sources are in src. Apart from the two BiExpâ€¦ they are copied from C Recipes.

I only included the Barankin bound calculator BiExpDeltaBarankinOrderJ.c but you are welcome to ask other programs (e.g. ML and MMSE estimators of the arrival time).

BiExpDeltaBarankinOrderJ.c makes many checks that are not strictly needed. Even just using C, this program could be easily made more efficient but my priority was safety.

Folder Test contains the executable compiled for MacPro (see Makefile), and one example of a command executed and of the program output ExampleOutput. I modified that output by adding comments in red colour in text file ExampleOutput.
